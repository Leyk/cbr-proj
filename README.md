Hello guys,
Here is just the beggining of my part. The different files are some tests, not real interesting things. 
In "file.py" I read the train.csv file, and in "db.py" I read it and store it in an object, but I am trying to make it better to be more general.
The idea would be :
- To read the first line of the csv file
- The first line of the csv file gives the number of attributes so,
- according to this, create a class "Data" with x attributes 
- Then to read the entire file and create objects of class "Data"

I have never done that before, but according to what I saw on the Internet I think it is called a "metaclass", maybe some of you have ever heard about it?
By the way, tell me if I am wrong and if what I plan to do is right.
Maybe in the future we could, in the main.py, ask the user to indicate where is the file to be loaded..?

See you next week !
